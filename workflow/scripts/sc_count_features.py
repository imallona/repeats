"""
Single-cell feature counter for STARsolo-tagged BAMs.

Counts reads from a STARsolo BAM against a feature GTF, with cell-barcode
whitelist filtering and UMI deduplication. Output mirrors STARsolo's
Solo.out/Gene/raw/ layout (matrix.mtx + features.tsv + barcodes.tsv).

Why this script:
  - STARsolo has no native re-count-from-BAM mode. To count a different
    feature_set against a gene-aligned BAM, you either re-align (expensive)
    or use a side counter.
  - Cell whitelist matters: STARsolo's "raw" matrix has one column per CB
    seen during alignment (millions, mostly noise). Restricting to the
    genes-pass barcodes.tsv keeps the matrix small and meaningful.
  - featureCounts is the obvious alternative but loads alignments into
    memory; this script streams the BAM and keeps memory bounded by the
    UMI dedup state (typically <1 GB per library).

Indexing strategy (intron-inclusive, like STARsolo --soloFeatures GeneFull):
  - If the GTF has `gene` records, those are indexed (one interval per
    gene spanning the entire transcript including introns; reads in
    introns count toward the gene).
  - Else if `transcript` records exist, those are indexed.
  - Else `exon` records (the repeat GTFs use exon-only with one exon per
    repeat locus; the entire repeat span is then covered by definition).
  This is more inclusive than STARsolo's default --soloFeatures Gene
  (which only counts exonic reads) and matches GeneFull semantics.

Assignment policy:
  - A read counts toward gene_id G iff its alignment overlaps exactly one
    GTF gene's indexed interval. Multi-feature overlap → discarded.
  - Reads without CB or UB tags are skipped.
  - Reads whose CB is not in the whitelist are skipped.

Multimapper handling (--multimapper):
  - unique : skip reads with NH > 1. Matches STARsolo's `Unique` setting
             exactly; pysam-unique and STARsolo-Unique counts on the same
             BAM and same dedup setting must agree.
  - multi  : include NH > 1 reads with weight 1/NH per alignment record.
             A multimapper read with NH=3 contributes 1/3 to each of its
             three feature assignments. This is non-iterative and
             linear-cost, unlike STARsolo's --soloMultiMappers EM which
             iterates a redistribution step. Numerical differences from
             EM are systematic: EM concentrates weight on genes with
             stronger unique-mapper support, while 1/NH spreads it
             uniformly across the candidate loci. For repeat-family
             quantification, where multimappers usually come from
             uniformly-mappable young subfamilies, the 1/NH uniform spread
             is the more conservative and arguably more honest choice.

             Known limitation: when a multimapper has more than one
             alternative falling in the same gene (e.g., two paralog
             positions of the same family), the implementation stores
             the max weight per (CB, gene, UMI) instead of summing
             positions. The molecule then contributes only 1/NH to that
             gene rather than k/NH (k = # alternatives in that gene).
             Sum across genes is therefore <= 1 for multimappers with
             intra-gene collisions, vs STARsolo's EM which would credit
             the gene proportionally to its alternative density. The
             simulation benchmark quantifies this bias against ground
             truth.

UMI deduplication (--umi-dedup):
  - 1mm_all    (default): collapse UMIs within Hamming distance 1 of each
                          other via union-find on the per-(CB, gene_id)
                          UMI graph. Matches STARsolo's default
                          --soloUMIdedup 1MM_All.
  - exact               : count distinct UB strings. Faster but
                          systematically over-counts unique molecules
                          because sequencing errors create spurious UMIs.
                          Use only for testing/debugging.

Granularity outputs:
  When the GTF carries family_id and/or class_id attributes (the repeat
  GTFs do; Ensembl genes do not), the script also writes per-granularity
  matrices side-by-side. Family/class counts are the post-UMI-dedup sum
  of their member gene_ids — equivalent to the rollup performed by
  granularity_rollup.R but produced in one pass.

Parallelism:
  - One worker per BAM contig. Each worker opens its own pysam handle
    (pysam handles are not fork-safe), processes one contig, and returns
    its local dict {(cb_idx, gene_id) -> set(UMIs)}. The main process
    merges per-key sets.

Output layout:
  <out_dir>/Solo.out/Gene/raw/{matrix.mtx|UniqueAndMult-EM.mtx,
                               features.tsv, barcodes.tsv}      gene_id
